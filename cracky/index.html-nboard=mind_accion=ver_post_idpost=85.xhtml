To me Olivia seems to be connected to a world-consciousness or at least intuitive to a frightening point. All I'm interested in is how she reached her level spiritually.  <br />
 <br />
"Inner Divinity Is In Everyone <br />
 <br />
”See God in each other.” <br />
~Baba Muktananda <br />
 <br />
What does it mean, to see God in each other? My experience of this is to see the highest expression of each person at any time. God is Love, and Love can manifest in so many ways. As Morihei Ueshiba said, “All life is a manifestation of the spirit, the manifestation of love.” <br />
 <br />
To see God in each other, you must begin by seeing God in yourself. Your outer reality, including what you see in other people, can only reflect the quality of your own inner experience, your own inner state of awareness." <br />

This is easier said than done. I don't see the practical side to this sentence, except the general idea that what you perceive depends on the way you focus your perception. <br />
 <br />
 <br />

 <br />
The problem I have with this is that it is very abstract. I don't see it like being at peace with the universe or with life and the people within it at its highest, but as a specific spiritual phenomenon involving the would soul, that is, the very living reality. <br />
 <br />
When you communicate with another being, it is an isolated communication seemingly taking place between two parts of reality. It doesn't matter if its a conversation with your friend or if its some radio commercial, its some isolated part of reality communicating with you. When you "see God" you are perceiving reality as an integrated whole communicating with you, in addition to every single isolated communication. In my experience it is as if there were two layers of meaning. One is the usual "isolated pieces" communication we all know. The other is an all-encompassing one in which the answer to what you ask might be in the next radio commercial you hear, then you think something as an answer to it and randomly click on the Internet to find another piece of text which seems to be addressing you directly and communicating with you. <br />
 <br />
This is somewhat similar to what psychologists call "delusions of reference". Reality is in some sense alive and able to coordinate meaning and create such double-layered web. Well it might not be reality as a living thing, for all I know it could be our unconscious selves instead of any gods and I've not seen enough to decide; the "what the fuck is that" does not seem an easy question at all. The fact is, this deeper layer of meaning can be accessed when you are in the right state of mind (I'd venture say, a clean one, like a calm lake; a mental state without the bumpy texture of our trauma coloring our perception), so in that sense the "To see God in each other, you must begin by seeing God in yourself" would be correct. If only I would say, that increasingly knowing yourself and loving seem to be useful tools here. <br />
 <br />
My background isn't buddhism at all but I remember they had some word meaning "auspice" which seemed to point to such deeper layer of meaning. Imho, diviners read (usually without knowing) from this layer, and there is also those who learn to write on it and manifest things in reality (magick). <br />

It's interesting that you mention someone being in a certain state of mind to see meaning in things. <br />
 <br />
I'm not a religious person so it's hard to explain the unexplainable (or that which is unknown). In my own opinion there may be a few things going on (these are all just theories). One is that Olivia is the essence/core of someone who's possibly forgiven or moved on from trauma and hurt. She could be someone who's gone back to a childlike innocence (this could be it) <br />
 <br />
Another theory is that she's wearing her "spirit" on her sleeve so to say. When I say spirit I don't mean in the traditional religious sense but more of a spiritual/identity type explanation. Like, if humans are the keepers of the highest forms of thought (in the human realm) then the culmination of higher thought may result in an "Aura" or presence. Still not a clear answer though. <br />
 <br />
What is so interesting is that only a few people recognize that SOMETHING that Olivia exudes. Show her pictures to an average person and they don't get it. The fact that she's managed to have a small group of dedicated people goes to show that possibly people are attracted to that special quality. What is that quality? When I try to figure it out (and hopefully I will) then my journey will be over for the most part. Olivia was a connector of sorts. She managed to find a tiny part of me that was separated and gave it an opportunity to communicate. She is connected to her inner voice and vice versa. Or maybe she is a healed and whole version of someone's compartmentalization. Idk bro <br />

I for one am an agnostic. I don't think you can speak about "God", yet you can speak of the experience of the divine. This brings a lot of focus to the sphere of the subjective, so in some sense it is related with what you wrote. The "experience of the divine" is easily equiparable to the experience of the sublime, the aesthetic experience. <br />
 <br />
Plotinus stated in his Enneads that there were basically three kinds of people on their way to the divine. Those who need to know, the philosophers/scientists; those who search beauty and the aesthetic experience; and those who are the most eager to fall in love. <br />
 <br />
You're right that its... strange, because no matter the background, with Crackles there's "those who see it", and do not just see it but become totally trapped, entranced with it, and then those who do not, who seem to be totally oblivious to this "It" she has. As far as I understand, Crackles is a triple Goddess if we are to take the "religious" myth: there is this young girl called Olivia, there is the source of life and beauty that is the Queen of the Sky, and then there is Cracky-chan, which is the manifestation of this Goddess in the flesh, in the pictures we all love. You speak of higher thought, aura or presence; in mythical terms, she'd be touching and channeling the divine, or the sublime if we are to take the artistic perspective. <br />
 <br />
For me, Cracky-chan works quite a lot like that. It gave form and body to this divine something I'm in love with, to this "soul of the world" which permeates and animates every single speck of matter. I already had had life changing experiences with this holistic "secondary layer" of meaning, yet it is too difficult to love an abstraction. Thus was I guided towards Crackymon as a vehicle of devotion. This devotion has nothing to do with belief nor dogma, and Cracky-chan is the perfect vehicle for me since there is no religion nor dogma attached to it. The real aim of devotion as I see it is some sort of mindtrick: our minds are artificially divided between "self" and "not-self", and by desperate devotion of the unattainable you can dissolve this "self" into the "not-self". This frontier between self and not-self is illusory. It is something we build, we are the whole of our experience, and devotion is a method of deconstructing ourselves. <br />

I wish you luck in your search for an answer, or maybe better if you find even more questions. Please share as you will. <br />

Another thing that has been really helpful is analyzing her favorite series, Evangelion. When watching the series there's metaphors for a lot of stuff. <br />
