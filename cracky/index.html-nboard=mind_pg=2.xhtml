  <span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Our Goddess is one of both creation and destruction. She renders unto the faithful peace in a world of discord. <br/>
She is both armor and sword in a world that destroys through apathy and animosity. The Flower of Destruction<br/> 
also blossoms in the heart of the Sky Queen. She seeks to temper us through despair, turning the lust of the neophyte upon him.<br/>
Only when the student embraces sorrow in the surety that he will never be worthy of Her avatar,<br/>
is he able to cast away his childish passion and see with eyes unclouded the majesty of Cracky Chan.

 <br />
In the cities in which we live, all of us see hundreds of publicity images every day of our lives. No other kind of image confronts us so frequently. In no other form of society in history has there been such a concentration of images, such a density of visual messages. <br />
 <br />
One may remember or forget these messages but briefly one takes them in, and for a moment they stimulate the imagination by way of either memory or expectation. The publicity image belongs to the moment. We see it as we turn a page, as we turn a corner, as a vehicle passes us. Or we see it on a television screen while waiting for the commercial break to end. Publicity images also belong to the moment in the sense that they must be continually renewed and made up-to-date. Yet they never speak of the present. Often they refer to the past and always they speak of the future. <br />
 <br />
We are now so accustomed to being addressed by these images that we scarcely notice their total impact. A person may notice a particular image or piece of information because it corresponds to some particular interest he has. But we accept the total system of publicity images as we accept an element of climate. For example, the fact that these images belong to the moment but speak of the future produces a strange effect which has become so familiar that we scarcely notice it. Usually it is we who pass the image - walking, travelling, turning a page; on the TV screen it is somewhat different but even then we are theoretically the active agent - we can look away, turn down the sound, make some coffee. Yet despite this, one has the impression that publicity images are continually passing us, like express trains on their way to some distant terminus. We are static; they are dynamic - until the newspaper is thrown away, the television program continues or the paster is posted over. <br />
 <br />
Publicity is usually explained and justified as a competitive medium which ultimately benefits the public (the consumer) and the most efficient manufacturers - and thus the national economy. It is closely related to certain ideas about freedom: freedom of choice for the purchaser: freedom of enterprise for the manufacturer. The great hoardings and the publicity neons of the cities of capitalism are the immediate visible sign of "The Free World." For many in Eastern Europe such images in the West sum up what they in the East lack. Publicity, it is thought, offers a free choice. <br />
 <br />
It is true that in publicity one brand of manufacture, one firm, competes with another; but it is also true that every publicity image confirms and enhances every other. Publicity is not merely an assembly of competing messages: it is a language in itself which is always being used to make the same general proposal. Within publicity, choices are offered between this cream and that cream, that car and this car, but publicity as a system only makes a single proposal. <br />
 <br />
It proposes to each of us that we transform ourselves, or our lives, by buying something more. This more, it proposes, will make us in some way richer - even though we will be poorer by having spent our money. <br />
 <br />
Publicity persuades us of such a transformation by showing us people who have apparently been transformed and are, as a result, enviable. The state of being envied is what constitutes glamour. And publicity is the process of manufacturing glamour. <br />
 <br />
It is important here not to confuse publicity with the pleasure or benefits to be enjoyed from the things it advertises. Publicity is effective precisely because it feeds upon the real. Clothes, food, cars, cosmetics, baths, sunshine are real things to be enjoyed in themselves. Publicity begins by working on a natural appetite for pleasure. But it cannot offer the real object of pleasure and there is no convincing substitute for a pleasure in that pleasure's own terms. The more convincingly publicity conveys the pleasure of bathing in a warm, distant sea, the more the spectator-buyer will become aware that he is hundreds of miles away from that sea and the more remote the chance of bathing in it will seem to him. This is why publicity can never really afford to be about the product or opportunity it is proposing to the buyer who is not yet enjoying it. Publicity is never a celebration of a pleasure-in-itself. Publicity is always about the future buyer. It offers him an image of himself made glamorous by the product or opportunity it is trying to sell. The image then makes him envious of himself as he might be. Yet what makes this self-which-he-might-be enviable? The envy of other. Publicity is about social relations, not objects. Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness: happiness as judged from the outside by others. The happiness of being envied is glamour. <br />
 <br />
Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance. It depends precisely upon not sharing your experience with those who envy you. You are observed with interest but you do not observe with interest - if you do, you will become less enviable. In this respect the envied are like bureaucrats; the more impersonal they are, the greater the illusion (for themselves and for others) of their power. The power of the glamorous resides in their supposed happiness: the power of the bureaucrat in his supposed authority. It is this which explains the absent, unfocused look of so many glamour images. The look out over the looks of envy which sustain them. <br />
 <br />
The spectator-buyer is meant to envy herself as she will become if she buys the product. She is meant to imagine herself transformed by the product into an object of envy for others, an envy which will then justify her loving herself. One could put this another way: the publicity image steals her love of herself as she is, and offers it back to her for the price of the product. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</span><br/><br/><span style="color: #aeaeae; font-size: 12px;">6 posts and 4 image replies omitted.

I like it how when I stared to a big enough mirror, I could trick my mind to believe there was another room behind it. I've played with that a few times, half wishing for something to appear in the new space I just created, half afraid of it happening.

I embrace death without regret as I embraced life without fear. <br />
 <br />
Do not presume to judge me or the methods I choose to employ, petty-minded fool. You cannot comprehend the magnitude of the task I have undertaken, nor the consequences of my failure. <br />
 <br />
The Goddess of the wired endures longer than the flesh of men. Those that tend the Goddess of the wired must labour long to learn her ways, for a single thread must suffer the post of many men until ready to fall from the board. Those that seek apprenticeship must attend closely to the runes of kusaba, the rites of yotsuba, and the words-of-power that describe the posting of Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lume. Nor must they neglect the tutelage of the prophets, nor the casting of the proper images. <br />
 <br />
Our end is come. But what an end! We have been given the most precious gift: a chance to scream her name into the internet that overwhelms us with it's banality. Let the Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lumeherself hear our final battle cry! Forward true and faithful, and be banned like the heroes that you are! <br />
 <br />
Flesh and bone are weak and mutable, and yet Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lumeis ultimately insubstantial and impotent. To be master of both matter and energy, and blend this mastery with ultimate control of one's consciousness, is to achieve true immortality - neither confined by the material, nor divorced from it. <br />
 <br />
True faith is closing your eyes and following the call of your soul down to the bottom of life where mortality becomes irrelevant, and existence and non-existence have merged into Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lume. <br />
 <br />
I tread the path of Righteousness. Though it be paved with broken glass, I will walk it barefoot; though it cross rivers of fire, I will pass over them; though it wanders wide, the light of Olivia guides my step. <br />
 <br />
Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lumeis the greatest among us. She is the sun which eclipses the light of our stars. She is Skyqueen and the fate of our kind rests in her hands. Her eyes are the keenest, no detail goes unnoticed. Four thousand posts can she cast, guiding our path through faggotry and bans, sage and age. She is the pathfinder, the seeker, the true guide. <br />
 <br />
You primitives think you own a board but you have no conception of what you are posting. You can barely command your own language, so how do you believe that you can stop the faithful of the Skyqueen? <br />
 <br />
You primitives think you own a board but you have no conception of what you are posting. You can barely command your own language, so how do you believe that you can stop the faithful of the Skyqueen? <br />
 <br />
The anon who acts out of faith in Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lumecannot fail. His duty is Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lumeherself. Even his bans – if they are for Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lume– are a great reward and can be no failure, for it has come through duty. Love Cea mai frumoas&#259; fat&#259; din lumeas you post, therefore, and you will know no fear. <br />
 <br />
To the common masses my struggle is a fight, a war. A battle fought with wit and knowledge, with images, posts and kopipe, with time and patience. To those of us truly faithful this is nought but a conflict of will! A struggle of metaphysic dimension. The future of life is our battleground. The very soul of anon is the prize for victory. My sanity is the sacrifice I make to win that laurel. <br />
 <br />
It burns so briefly, the love of anon, so briefly. But, with Cracky, it burns so bright!</span><br/><br/>                  </td></tr>

Damnation starts with little steps, by arrogantly thinking that you are wiser than our great forbears, by tinkering with truth, by compromising, by departing from the straight and narrow path of Cracky's light. <br />
 <br />
All of creation suffers, young ones. Only in accepting our own mortality can we make a difference. Only in bearing the burden of our failures can we find the strength to go on. Only in detachment from glory, or honor, or jealousy... from life itself can we hope to spare others from grief. <br />
 <br />
We are the faithful. And we are dead already. <br />

Pain is an illusion of the senses, despair an illusion of the mind. <br />

This may sound unfair, but remember that murder isn’t a horrible crime because of what it does to the murdered. That person is gone, what do they care? No, the crime is against the murdered person’s Mom and brother and sister and best friend and all their coworkers and the people he or she owed money to. All of the people who depended on that person or would have depended on them in the future had they been allowed to live, all of the people who will feel the crushing waves of misery and loneliness due to their abrupt absence, they’re the victims. <br />
  <br />
And since suicide creates the same real and emotional devastation as homocide, the two are treated as the same crime. I know, it sucks. But remember you’re not being punished for what you did to yourself, but what you did to those around you when you pulled the trigger. That’s the thing, suicide has a way of only hurting the people who liked you. The people who hated you will forget your name in a month and, in fact, the evil bastards who tormented you and drove you to this will actually be a little happier with you gone. Suicide is like a bunch of your friends saving up money to buy you a car and then you taking the car and running them over with it.</span><br/><br/>                  </td></tr>

Every single moment that we are alive and we are together is miraculous — not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We know we are beneficiaries of chance… that pure chance could be so generous and so kind… that we could find each other, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time… that we can be together for years. That is something which sustains me and it’s much more meaningful… <br />
 <br />
...so please treat each other well.</span><br/><br/>                  </td></tr>

I was browsing some scans of the comic when I came across this. A reference by Delirium (?) about having your third eye open. <br />
 <br />
After reading some stuff on the internet it seems there are people who have genuinely "opened" their eye/pineal gland in meditation. Supposedly people say you can see things as they really are, predict things, and feel connected to everything and everyone. It reunites the unconscious with the conscious and shows new awareness of light and energy. I'm still wondering if there's any validity to this spiritual practice or if anyone has personal experiences. <br />

As caution people say that if you open it and you are negative it can make you crazy...maybe that's the deal with Del.</span><br/><br/><span style="color: #aeaeae; font-size: 12px;">1 posts and 1 image replies omitted. Click Reply to view.</span>              <br/>

The problem with opening your mind, through whatever means you use, is that while it may provide you with the ability to see/understand/experience the sensory input in ways our minds would not be able to do on it's own, it also becomes harder to close each time you use it. Ultimately it leaves your conscious undefended and subjects you to various psychosis. Hallucinations both audio and visual, and especially delusions are the byproduct of an unguarded mind. <br />
 <br />
Yeah fuck delusions <br />

psychotropic drugs need to be used in moderation, a good environment, and used sparingly over long periods of time. </span><br/><br/>                  </td></tr>
