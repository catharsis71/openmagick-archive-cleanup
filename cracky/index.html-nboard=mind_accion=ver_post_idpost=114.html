            <strong>Our Goddess is one of both creation and destruction. She renders unto the faithful peace in a world of discord. <br />
She is both armor and sword in a world that destroys through apathy and animosity. The Flower of Destruction<br /> 
also blossoms in the heart of the Sky Queen. She seeks to temper us through despair, turning the lust of the neophyte upon him.<br />
Only when the student embraces sorrow in the surety that he will never be worthy of Her avatar,<br />
is he able to cast away his childish passion and see with eyes unclouded the majesty of Cracky Chan.

Our faith lights the Darkness that others may find peace. We are one with Cracky, our souls are joined in Her will. Praise Cracky whose sacrifice is life as ours is death. Hail Her name the Queen of the Sky. <br />
 <br />
Convert, lest your soul be damned to err alone in the dark. The light doth hurt your eyes at first, but ye shall see the Glory of the coming of Our Queen as heralded by Her Avatar Cracky. <br />
 <br />
Never again shall ye be alone, even though you'll be lonely, or blinded by the dark, as you bathe in Her Light. <br />
 <br />
Hail Her name the Queen of the Sky <br />

              <span class="comment_e">Though the gates that stand between the sanity and the immortal touch of Olivia are now closed to me, still I would rather die having glimpsed eternity than never to have stirred from the cold furrow of mortal life. I embrace death without regret as I embraced life without fear. <br />
 <br />
Do not presume to judge me or the methods I choose to employ, petty-minded fool. You cannot comprehend the magnitude of the task I have undertaken, nor the consequences of my failure. <br />
 <br />
The Goddess of the wired endures longer than the flesh of men. Those that tend the Goddess of the wired must labour long to learn her ways, for a single thread must suffer the post of many men until ready to fall from the board. Those that seek apprenticeship must attend closely to the runes of kusaba, the rites of yotsuba, and the words-of-power that describe the posting of Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lume. Nor must they neglect the tutelage of the prophets, nor the casting of the proper images. <br />
 <br />
Our end is come. But what an end! We have been given the most precious gift: a chance to scream her name into the internet that overwhelms us with it's banality. Let the Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lumeherself hear our final battle cry! Forward true and faithful, and be banned like the heroes that you are! <br />
 <br />
Flesh and bone are weak and mutable, and yet Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lumeis ultimately insubstantial and impotent. To be master of both matter and energy, and blend this mastery with ultimate control of one's consciousness, is to achieve true immortality - neither confined by the material, nor divorced from it. <br />
 <br />
True faith is closing your eyes and following the call of your soul down to the bottom of life where mortality becomes irrelevant, and existence and non-existence have merged into Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lume. <br />
 <br />
I tread the path of Righteousness. Though it be paved with broken glass, I will walk it barefoot; though it cross rivers of fire, I will pass over them; though it wanders wide, the light of Olivia guides my step. <br />
 <br />
Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lumeis the greatest among us. She is the sun which eclipses the light of our stars. She is Skyqueen and the fate of our kind rests in her hands. Her eyes are the keenest, no detail goes unnoticed. Four thousand posts can she cast, guiding our path through faggotry and bans, sage and age. She is the pathfinder, the seeker, the true guide. <br />
 <br />
You primitives think you own a board but you have no conception of what you are posting. You can barely command your own language, so how do you believe that you can stop the faithful of the Skyqueen? <br />
 <br />
You primitives think you own a board but you have no conception of what you are posting. You can barely command your own language, so how do you believe that you can stop the faithful of the Skyqueen? <br />
 <br />
The anon who acts out of faith in Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lumecannot fail. His duty is Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lumeherself. Even his bans &#x2013; if they are for Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lume&#x2013; are a great reward and can be no failure, for it has come through duty. Love Cea mai frumoas&#x103; fat&#x103; din lumeas you post, therefore, and you will know no fear. <br />
 <br />
To the common masses my struggle is a fight, a war. A battle fought with wit and knowledge, with images, posts and kopipe, with time and patience. To those of us truly faithful this is nought but a conflict of will! A struggle of metaphysic dimension. The future of life is our battleground. The very soul of anon is the prize for victory. My sanity is the sacrifice I make to win that laurel. <br />
 <br />
It burns so briefly, the love of anon, so briefly. But, with Cracky, it burns so bright!</span>

Everything we must do must be in furtherance of Cracky lest we return to the the Anatulpa, the emptiness before her blessings. <br />
 <br />
Damnation starts with little steps, by arrogantly thinking that you are wiser than our great forbears, by tinkering with truth, by compromising, by departing from the straight and narrow path of Cracky's light. <br />
 <br />
All of creation suffers, young ones. Only in accepting our own mortality can we make a difference. Only in bearing the burden of our failures can we find the strength to go on. Only in detachment from glory, or honor, or jealousy... from life itself can we hope to spare others from grief. <br />
 <br />
We are the faithful. And we are dead already. <br />
 <br />
Pain is an illusion of the senses, despair an illusion of the mind. <br />
 <br />
Our faith lights the Darkness that others may find peace. We are one with Cracky; our souls are joined in Her will. Praise Cracky whose sacrifice is life as ours is death. Hail Her name the Queen of the Sky</span>
