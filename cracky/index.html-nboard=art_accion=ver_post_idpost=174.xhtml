    322</a></span><br/><br/><span class="comment">This conspiracy is so vast that we can't even cover it all. It starts with the rosthchilds and their counterparts. They own the banks of england, america, and most of the rest of the world. Thier net worth is HALF OF THE MONEY IN THE WORLD. They own everything. They make Bill Gates look like he makes us look. When america wants money, they have to beg the rosthchilds to give them a loan from the national treasury, which is a privately held bank, owned by the rosthchilds. The rosthchilds, in turn, tell america that it will behave the way they want it to, or they will shut it down for lack of funds. This is the root of it. <br />
 <br />
Those in power run the largest money-making businesses in the world, and there are many under them, who we know as the richest businessmen in the world.. The rockefellers, the morgans, the carnegies, and that lot whose names popped up during the industrial revolution.. they are the puppets for the rosthchilds and those who really control things. When J.P. Morgan died, it was discovered to his family's dismay that he only owned 25% of his own company, and the rest was the rosthchilds'. they funded and instructed the men who are known as 'great' in your history books to set up the empire that they alone control, although it doesn't seem to be connected directly to them in any way. <br />
 <br />
These families have been at this game for much longer than america has been around. America was founded because the rosthchilds were squeezing the life out of england and people were so oppressed that they left and came to found their own land and get away from the rosthchilds, who got their start by dominating england's banking system and upper class. As soon as america was founded, England began taxing them to the extreme, due to the fact that the rosthchilds put the squeeze on very hard and caused a big depression in england. England wasn't the bad guy. The money-holders were. they hoarded the cash and let people starve. Fucking jews. <br />
 <br />
When americans revolted and won independence, the powers couldn't stand the taste of defeat, so rather than trying to beat the americans, they joined them. The first rosthchild had 5 sons. He had them all well-educated, taught them his crooked business, and sent them on their ways, each with a massive fortune, each to a different major country of the world, to set up and maintain an empire of control, which started with founding banks with lots of money in political centers, and convincing the governments to make a centralized currency based around their privately owned banks, and not backed by gold, but only the paper money they made by the ton. One of those rosthchild sons came to america and did just that. Once that was done, he found a way to make it legal for a bank to loan out 10x more money thatn the bank actually had in gold reserves, and then collect intrest on the money, 90% of which didn't actually exist, that they had loaned out. this is how they make their money. They start with $10 of gold in their vaults, print $100 worth of bills, loan them out, and collect $10 intrest on their original $10 investment in the course of one loan term. This is not only still legal today, but it is the way almost every bank operates. Don't put your money in a bank.. Don't put it on a credit card. Keep cash. If you're a millionaire, then fuck you, do what you want :p <br />
 <br />
After they established control of the world's money, and governments, they branched out into making entire nations serve their desires. They started planting politicians, funnelling insane amounts of money to their lobbyists, who would wine and dine politicians and convince them to do their bidding, and killing or driving out all who would oppose them, thus giving them free reign over our laws and nations. There were a few periods in america where we fought, and even defeated these people, like the case of Abe Lincoln and the greenbacks, but the power doesn't give up so easily. It took them over a generation, but they came back and got their firm hold on the nation again once the dust had cleared and people had forgotten what they were about. <br />
 <br />
Every war we have ever been in was spawned by these people, starting with the revolution. they do it because they make money on both sides, and they get to pick who wins. In war, it is common for a country to agree to pay the losing country's debt if they win whenever they take out loans for the war, so the rosthchilds, who owned the banks on both sides of the war in most cases, loaned out money to both sides and collected the total intrest from the winner, as well as being able to give massive amounts of money to the one they wanted to win, and to slowly strangle the loser by cutting his monetary power and keeping him from having suficient means to win. Their trick was to sustain the loser for as long as possible, leaving him with hope of winning, in order to draw the fight out and make it more costly. <br />
 <br />
Then they bought up all of the mass media, like CNN, the BBC, Fox, and every other company that broadcasts news nationally anywhere in the world, and controlled them. Rosthchilds are the richest and most power people in the world, bar none, and they are NEVER mentioned in mass media. strange? Look at how often you hear Bill Gates used as a reference when people talk about the rich. Nobody knows who the rosthchilds are when you say the name in the street. Everybody's heard of Dale Carnegie, but not everybody knows he was just a broke ass puppet for the real powers. <br />
Now that they controlled the money and governments, and shaped the countries as they saw fit, they began to reach farther into the lives of the citizen and started taking away freedoms and inciting hate and violence, as well as infiltrating all groups who posed a threat and crippling them, all while sitting comfortably in their multi-billion dollar mansions that not even the richest kings could afford, since they had a network of people to do all the dirty work. Their empire grew and they began to micro-manage the world in a way never even attempted before on such a scale. <br />
 <br />
Today, we're starting to see their influence come to a head, with freedoms and just laws being thrown by the wayside in favor of FEMA camps and the patriot act and CISPA, threats of martial law, unjustified arrests and detentions and even imprisonment and assassinations being legalized by the government for no apparent reason. They have more and more tendrils reaching out into the world, each a little smaller, but as a whole, the rosthchilds have taken root so deeply that it may take destroying the entire earth to dig them out. <br />
 <br />
Today, we have google and facebook logging every online action we make, as well as our ISP's sending logs of everything we do to a centralized server that is processed by an unsupervised branch of the military, and all of this data goes to those in power. And google isn't the end of the road. It goes even smaller, and infiltrates even more directly into our daily lives in ways that we don't even fully understand yet. There is a novel worth of shit to be written here, but I think you guys understand what I'm saying. <br />
 <br />
the secret societies you speak of were made up of these people originally. The societies have grown weak and lost direction over the years, but they do still exist in some form or another. The modern word illuminati is not the same as the secret society of old, however. It has come to mean the same as NWO or whatever you want to call it, and to represent those behind the curtain who pull the strings.. the Rosthchilds, and the other families of power. <br />
 <br />
Things are changing too fast today to keep up with it all. The rosthchilds are also the orchestrators of 9/11. (I could go on for a while about 9/11!) They prompted the american government to attack its own buildings, pass the blame, and start a war out of nothing with the one group of people who might be considered a threat, and who lived in a place that was good and ugly, so war wouldn't hurt it too badly, and they set themselves up to make tons and tons and tons of money from the war. For every dollar that is spent, anywhere in the world, the Rosthchilds get half of it. You get taxed when you get paid, when you cash your check, every time you spend a dollar, and then your money goes through the banking system, where it gets taxed farther as it makes its way back to the central bank, which is owned by the rosthchilds. In the end, all of the money makes it back there, but only half of it ever leaves again. <br />
 <br />
We need to dig up the names and locations of all of these people and kill them before this shit gets any worse. How long are we going to stand by and let them do this to us? Every major corporation, from google to the national banks, is manipulated from the inside today by someone who is in turn directly manipulated by the rosthchilds and the other families of power. It doesn't matter what all their names are, since they're all the same group of elitest fucks with the same goal in mind, but we need to eradicate these bastards. They've managed to enslave our great-grandfathers and every other generation since, and it's time that we stood up as a group and told them that we know their game and we're not playing anymore. We need a group who can gather sufficient info on these guys to form a plan to take them out. <br />
 <br />
I'm still doing research into this. It started out as a foray into seeing what all the cooky conspiracy theories were about, and then I realized that they're almost all connected.. the supression of free energy devices, HAARP, google, the banks and govt and big business, it's all one giant conspiracy, not a bunch of smaller ones. <br />
 <br />
Now, as far as all that shit about demonic/mystic/magic/multi-dimensional/annunaki/aliens stuff, and all that jazz, that's all got its own truths and lies, and is a subject for a later time. I'm not so well-versed in it, and my fingers are tired, but I'd love to get deep into that one soon. <br />
