	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Our Goddess is one of both creation and destruction. She renders unto the faithful peace in a world of discord. <br/>
She is both armor and sword in a world that destroys through apathy and animosity. The Flower of Destruction<br/> 
also blossoms in the heart of the Sky Queen. She seeks to temper us through despair, turning the lust of the neophyte upon him.<br/>
Only when the student embraces sorrow in the surety that he will never be worthy of Her avatar,<br/>
is he able to cast away his childish passion and see with eyes unclouded the majesty of Cracky Chan.

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. <br />

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds...</span><br/><br/>		<table bgcolor="#1e1e1e" cellpadding="10px"

        <a href="magick/398.jpg" target="blank_"><img class="thumb" src="magick/398_thumb.jpg" border="0" /></a><br/><span class="comment_e">Suicide is worse than murder… <br />
This may sound unfair, but remember that murder isn’t a horrible crime because of what it does to the murdered. That person is gone, what do they care? No, the crime is against the murdered person’s Mom and brother and sister and best friend and all their coworkers and the people he or she owed money to. All of the people who depended on that person or would have depended on them in the future had they been allowed to live, all of the people who will feel the crushing waves of misery and loneliness due to their abrupt absence, they’re the victims. <br />
  <br />
And since suicide creates the same real and emotional devastation as homocide, the two are treated as the same crime. I know, it sucks. But remember you’re not being punished for what you did to yourself, but what you did to those around you when you pulled the trigger. That’s the thing, suicide has a way of only hurting the people who liked you. The people who hated you will forget your name in a month and, in fact, the evil bastards who tormented you and drove you to this will actually be a little happier with you gone. Suicide is like a bunch of your friends saving up money to buy you a car and then you taking the car and running them over with it.</span><br/><br/>              </td></tr></table>

I don’t ever expect to be reunited with my family or friends. But, the great thing is that when we are together, for however long, we will live with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. Never trivialize the meaning of death by pretending it is anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we are alive and we are together is miraculous — not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We know we are beneficiaries of chance… that pure chance could be so generous and so kind… that we could find each other, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time… that we can be together for years. That is something which sustains me and it’s much more meaningful… <br />
 <br />
...so please treat each other well.</span><br/><br/>              </td></tr></table>
