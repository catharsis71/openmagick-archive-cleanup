            <strong>Our Goddess is one of both creation and destruction. She renders unto the faithful peace in a world of discord. <br />
She is both armor and sword in a world that destroys through apathy and animosity. The Flower of Destruction<br /> 
also blossoms in the heart of the Sky Queen. She seeks to temper us through despair, turning the lust of the neophyte upon him.<br />
Only when the student embraces sorrow in the surety that he will never be worthy of Her avatar,<br />
is he able to cast away his childish passion and see with eyes unclouded the majesty of Cracky Chan.

To begin to master the concept of mental disciplines it is necessary to examine the self. The polarity of your dimension must be internalized. Where you find patience within your mind you must consciously find the corresponding impatience and vice versa. Each thought a being has, has in its turn an antithesis. The disciplines of the mind involve, first of all, identifying both those things of which you approve and those things of which you disapprove within yourself, and then balancing each and every positive and negative charge with its equal. The mind contains all things. Therefore, you must discover this completeness within yourself.</span>

Yet isn't desire caused because the person detects even unconsciously the intelligent infinity as the cause of desire, beyond desire? How could this ever be reached, since the physical plane doesn't lead to its attainment and even imagination seems to be a better suited tool to reach the farthest edges of desire? <br />

The identity of the vibration Cracky is our identity. We as a group, or what you would call a social memory complex, made contact with a people of your/our kind seeming imagination. Others from our density made contact at the same time in the physical, and the so-called &#x201C;lost rarez&#x201D; were their attempts to contribute to the Law of One. We spoke to one who heard and understood and was in a position to decree the Law of One. However, the prophet and peoples of that era quickly distorted our message, robbing it of the, shall we say, compassion with which unity is informed by its very nature. Since it contains all, it cannot abhor any. <br />
When we were no longer able to have appropriate channels through which to enunciate the Law of One, we removed ourselves from the now hypocritical position which we had allowed ourselves to be placed in. Other myths, shall we say, having more to do with polarity and the things of your vibration that are complex, again took over in that particular society/complex. <br />

              <span class="comment_e">Love is a key to healing. <br />
 <br />
Nothing heals better emotionally, biochemically, physically and mentally than love - or experiencing the frequency of romantic love as all is frequency. It is like a drug that heals, but one must watch out for the side effects, such as obsession. If you have never felt this love, your soul may seek to heal the issues which will allow you to attract this experience. Some people are happier and healthier giving love, while others need to be loved to remain healthy. Love should be in balance as that is the key word in all healing. <br />
 <br />
Love affects most species as they seek to create peace and balance in their experience here. The ultimate healing from love comes with union/reunion of self. <br />
 <br />
As you know love is the emotion most sought after on our journey in physical reality. Romantic love is a high that is often addictive in our need to obtain and keep it. When we experience it, we revel in the bliss love elicits and bask in the warmth that blankets us with caring, gratitude, comfort, and a sense of all-around well being. This wonderful feeling we call love does, indeed, create well-being. In fact, feeling love sets forth a complex series of events within our bodies that generally bring about better health. <br />
 <br />
A distinction must be made between "falling in love" and "being in love" or feeling love in general. Simply defined, falling in love is part of the initial stage of a relationship, in which we feel strong passionate feelings of attraction, both emotional and physical, to another person. If we are fortunate, this stage leads to being in love, a deeper devotion and affection, which may develop and deepen over time. Feeling love is much like being in love. However, we can feel love for someone who is not a romantic partner; in fact, we more often feel love without being "in love." We frequently extend the more general kind of love to relatives, friends, even pets.</span>

              <span class="comment_e">Numerous studies prove that love does, indeed, improve our health. These studies look at love not only in the context of male-female primary relationships, such as marriage, but also in the context of a person's general social support and connection to others. In other words, these studies examine both relationships where participants are "in love" and those in which we feel love for someone. <br />
 <br />
Dean Ornish, M.D., has served as a pioneer in this work. In his book, Love and Survival, the Scientific Basis for the Healing Power of Intimacy he reports on many such studies. For example, he helped conduct a study at Yale that involved 119 men and 40 women undergoing coronary angiography. Those who felt the most loved and supported had substantially less blockages in their heart arteries than the other subjects. In a related study, researchers looked at almost 10 thousand married men with no prior history of angina. These men had high levels of risk factors, such as elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Those who felt their wives did not show them love experienced almost twice as much angina as the first group, who felt their wives did show them love. <br />
 <br />
While feeling loved appears to benefit our heart's health, giving love seems to do the same for our aging process. The results of a study of more than 700 elderly adults showed that the effects of aging were influenced more by what the participants contributed to their social support network than what they received from it. In other words, the more love and support they gave, the more they benefited. <br />
 <br />
Social ties with friends, family, workers, and community that involve love and intimacy of any type also may help protect against infectious diseases. In a study of 276 healthy volunteers ranging in age from 18 to 55, all participants received nasal drops containing rhinovirus, which causes the common cold. Researchers assessed subjects on 12 types of relationships, including relationship with spouse, parents, parents-in-law, children and other close family members, neighbors, friends, co-workers schoolmates, and member of various groups. They scored a point for each type of relationship if they spoke to a person in that category at least once every two weeks. While almost all of the people exposed to the cold virus were infected, not everyone developed the signs and symptoms of a cold. The participants who reported only one to three types of relationships had more than four times the risk of developing a cold than those reporting six or more types of relationships. <br />
 <br />
"When you feel loved, nurtured, cared for, supported, and intimate, you are much more likely to be happier and healthier. You have a much lower risk of getting sick and, if you do, a much greater chance of surviving," Ornish concludes in his book.</span>

Yet love all too much or all too sudden can as well break down the strongest of wills.  <br />
 <br />
Anguish and desperate loving can become the result of a feeling so deep.</span>
