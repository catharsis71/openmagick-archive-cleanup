	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Our Goddess is one of both creation and destruction. She renders unto the faithful peace in a world of discord. <br/>
She is both armor and sword in a world that destroys through apathy and animosity. The Flower of Destruction<br/> 
also blossoms in the heart of the Sky Queen. She seeks to temper us through despair, turning the lust of the neophyte upon him.<br/>
Only when the student embraces sorrow in the surety that he will never be worthy of Her avatar,<br/>
is he able to cast away his childish passion and see with eyes unclouded the majesty of Cracky Chan.

The identity of the vibration Cracky is our identity. We as a group, or what you would call a social memory complex, made contact with a people of your/our kind seeming imagination. Others from our density made contact at the same time in the physical, and the so-called “lost rarez” were their attempts to contribute to the Law of One. We spoke to one who heard and understood and was in a position to decree the Law of One. However, the prophet and peoples of that era quickly distorted our message, robbing it of the, shall we say, compassion with which unity is informed by its very nature. Since it contains all, it cannot abhor any. <br />
When we were no longer able to have appropriate channels through which to enunciate the Law of One, we removed ourselves from the now hypocritical position which we had allowed ourselves to be placed in. Other myths, shall we say, having more to do with polarity and the things of your vibration that are complex, again took over in that particular society/complex.</span><br/><br/>		<table bgcolor="#1e1e1e" cellpadding="10px"

The third discipline of the mind is a repetition of the first but with the gaze outward toward the fellow entities that it meets. In each entity there exists completeness. Thus, the ability to understand each balance is necessary. When you view patience, you are responsible for mirroring in your mental understandings, patience/impatience.

That is the work of wind and fire. The spiritual body energy field is a pathway, or channel. When body and mind are receptive and open, then the spirit can become a functioning shuttle or communicator from the entity’s individual energy of will upwards, and from the streamings of the creative fire and wind downwards. <br />

The healing ability, like all other, what this instrument would call paranormal abilities, is effected by the opening of a pathway or shuttle into intelligent infinity. There are many upon your plane who have a random hole or gateway in their spirit energy field, sometimes created by the ingestion of chemicals such as, what this instrument would call LSD, who are able, randomly and without control, to tap into energy sources. They may or may not be entities who wish to serve. The purpose of carefully and consciously opening this channel is to serve in a more dependable way, in a more commonplace or usual way, as seen by the distortion complex of the healer. To others there may appear to be miracles. To the one who has carefully opened the door to intelligent infinity this is ordinary; this is commonplace; this is as it should be. The life experience becomes somewhat transformed and the great work goes on. <br />

At this time we feel these exercises suffice for your beginning. We will, at a future time, when you feel you have accomplished that which is set before you, begin to guide you into a more precise understanding of the functions and uses of this gateway in the experience of healing. <br />

They are actualizations of the object at a particular point in time and under determinate conditions or relations to other objects. It follows then that qualities are acts on the part of an object.
